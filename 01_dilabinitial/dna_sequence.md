# Li Lab Initial Presentation

This presentation is based on the following four aspects, as we mentioned in the previous meeting:
- DNA Sequence
- RNA Sequence
- DNA Methylation Array
- Illumina Sequence

## DNA Sequence

### Definition of DNA sequence
DNA sequence is the process of determining the **nucleic acid sequence**

### Applications of DNA sequence
Here's a first footnote [^1] and here's the second number footnote [^2]. We can also insert a third number footnote [^3]. There can be multiple footnotes in a document.
